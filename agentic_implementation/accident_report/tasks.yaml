airbag_signal_task:
  description: >
    Use GPT-4o to analyze the airbag image at {airbag_image} and confirm that the airbag is deployed.
    Return the accident footage directory path.
  expected_output: "A string representing the accident footage directory, which is '/home/abdulla.almarzooqi/Desktop/Thesis/datasets/car-crash-dataset-ccd/CrashBest'"
  agent: airbag_status_agent

video_preprocess_task:
  description: >
    Using the accident footage from {airbag_signal_task} and the provided video ID {accident_video_id},
    sample frames from the footage using the following technique:
      - Sample every 5 frames before the accident frame,
      - Include the accident frame (assumed to be frame 25),
      - Sample every 2 frames after the accident frame.
    Return a dictionary (as a string) with keys "frames" (a list of file paths) and "accident_frame" (an integer).
  expected_output: "A JSON dictionary with 'frames' and 'accident_frame'."
  agent: video_preprocess_agent
  context:
    - airbag_signal_task

  description: >
    Retrieve the current weather condition at the accident scene.
  expected_output: "A string that should be 'Normal'."
  agent: weather_condition_agent

  expected_output: "A statement indicating whether the seatbelt was 'fastened' or 'not fastened'."
  agent: seatbelt_status_agent
  multimodal: true

    Generate a comprehensive accident report using the following inputs:
      - Weather Condition: {weather_condition_task}
      - Seatbelt Status: {seatbelt_status_task}
      - Airbag Status: "deployed"
      - Extracted Frames: {video_preprocess_task}

  agent: accident_report_generation_agent
  context:
    - weather_condition_task
    - seatbelt_status_task
    - video_preprocess_task
